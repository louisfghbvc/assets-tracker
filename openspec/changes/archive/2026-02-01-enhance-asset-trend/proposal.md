# Proposal: Enhance Asset Trend Visualization

## Problem Statement
The current asset trend visualization is a basic area chart showing the total balance over time. While functional, it lacks depth, flexibility, and the professional feel expected of a premium financial companion. Users cannot switch time ranges, view profit percentages, mark important events, or enjoy modern visual aesthetics.

## Proposed Solution
Enhance the `TrendChart` component and the `trend-view` to support:
1. **Multiple Display Modes**: Toggle between absolute total value and profit/loss percentage.
2. **Time Range Selection**: View data over specific periods (1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y, MAX).
3. **Event Annotation**: Ability to add and display notes/events on specific dates in the history.
4. **Premium Visuals**: Implement smooth curves (Bezier), dynamic gradients, and color-coded trends (up/down).

## Outcomes
- A more interactive and informative asset trend view.
- Better user understanding of asset growth vs. investment performance.
- A "wow" factor through high-end visualizations.
- A functional investment diary through event markers.
