# Proposal: Show Absolute Profit Display

## Problem
The current UI primarily displays the percentage change of an asset's value relative to its cost basis. Users cannot easily see the actual dollar amount (absolute profit/loss) they have earned or lost for each asset and for their entire portfolio.

## Proposed Solution
- Add absolute profit/loss values to the asset cards in the main list.
- Update the header's "Total Balance" section to clearly show the total profit/loss amount in addition to the percentage change.
- Refine translations to correctly label "Total Profit" instead of the ambiguous "than yesterday" where appropriate.

## Goals
- Allow users to see the exact monetary gain/loss for each asset.
- Provide a clear overview of the total portfolio performance in absolute terms.

## Non-Goals
- Historical profit tracking over time (this feature is about current profit based on cost basis).
- Tax calculations.
