# Tasks: Complete Localization and Intuitive Language Toggle

- [x] Add market localization keys to `src/translations.ts`.
- [x] Update `AddAssetModal.tsx` to use localized market names and ensure all other strings use `t()`.
- [x] Update `EditAssetModal.tsx` to ensure all strings use `t()`.
- [x] Refactor the language toggle button in `App.tsx` to show the active language.
- [x] Localize all `setSyncStatus` calls in `App.tsx` (refreshing, syncing, success/fail messages).
- [x] Verify that all "popups" (modals) are fully translated when the language is changed.
